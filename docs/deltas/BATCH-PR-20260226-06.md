## Delta 2026-02-26 (BATCH-PR-20260226-06): Callback Exception Observability + Parser Config Guardrails

### P2 - PendingAction callback exception reporting can be silent
- Problem description: `PendingAction` callback exception handling can become silent when the callback exception handler is missing or when that handler throws.
- Dialer impact: Application-visible callback failures can be lost, reducing incident observability and delaying production triage in long-running dialer workers.
- Required invariant: Callback exception paths must always emit at least one observable signal (log line and/or metric), even when secondary handlers fail.
- Concrete implementation direction: In `PendingAction::invokeCallback()`, add a deterministic fallback path that records callback exceptions when the handler is null or fails; wrap handler invocation in its own `try/catch` and emit structured fallback telemetry with server/action context.
- Tasks: PR6-P2-01, PR6-P2-02

### P2 - Parser buffer cap can be set below frame-size requirements
- Problem description: Parser constructor currently allows `bufferCap` values that are smaller than `maxFrameSize` (+ delimiter), which can desync valid frames before frame-size checks are reached.
- Dialer impact: Valid large AMI frames can force avoidable parser desync and reconnect churn under high-volume dialer traffic.
- Required invariant: Parser configuration must fail fast unless `bufferCap >= maxFrameSize + delimiter_bytes` (or an explicitly documented stronger minimum).
- Concrete implementation direction: Validate constructor/config invariants for parser sizing; throw `InvalidConfigurationException` on invalid relationships, and document the enforced formula in config and runtime profile docs.
- Tasks: PR6-P2-03, PR6-P2-04

New/Updated Invariants:
- Callback exception handling is never silent, including handler-null and handler-throws branches.
- Parser configuration is invalid unless `bufferCap` can safely contain at least one maximum-sized frame plus framing delimiter.
