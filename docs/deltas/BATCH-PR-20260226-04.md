### Delta 2026-02-26 (BATCH-PR-20260226-04): Non-Blocking DNS + Async Connect Verification + Redaction

### P1 - Tick Loop Fully Non-Blocking (Hostname/DNS)
- Problem description: Hostname endpoints can trigger blocking DNS resolution during reconnect, because connect is initiated inside tick-driven paths.
- Dialer impact: A single DNS stall can freeze the tick loop and starve other nodes and timeouts.
- Required invariant: Tick loop fully non-blocking; no DNS or other blocking I/O inside tick/reconnect paths.
- Concrete implementation direction: Enforce IP-only endpoints in production OR pre-resolve hostnames at bootstrap and inject IPs; if hostnames are allowed, resolve outside tick with a cached, non-blocking resolver and never call blocking DNS from processTick().
- Tasks: PR4-P1-01, PR4-P1-02

### P2 - Async Connect Verification Without ext-sockets
- Problem description: When socket helper functions are unavailable, async connect is marked as successful without verification, yielding false-positive connected state.
- Dialer impact: Actions may be queued to a dead socket, delaying failure feedback and increasing retry churn.
- Required invariant: Connection state must only transition to connected after a verified async-connect success.
- Concrete implementation direction: Require ext-sockets in production or implement a portable verification fallback (stream_get_meta_data + non-blocking write probe with error handling). If verification is impossible, treat the connect as failed and close the socket.
- Tasks: PR4-P2-01, PR4-P2-02

### P3 - Value-Based Secret Redaction
- Problem description: Redaction is key-based only; secrets embedded in free-form values or non-sensitive keys can be logged.
- Dialer impact: Confidential data leakage under verbose logging.
- Required invariant: Logs must not expose secrets embedded in values; redaction must apply to structured context payloads.
- Concrete implementation direction: Add configurable value-based regex redaction and ensure action/event payloads are passed through the redactor before logging.
- Tasks: PR4-P3-01, PR4-P3-02

New/Updated Invariants:
- Tick loop fully non-blocking (no DNS resolution or blocking I/O inside tick/reconnect paths).
