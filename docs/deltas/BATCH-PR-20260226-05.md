### Delta 2026-02-26 (BATCH-PR-20260226-05): Transport/Logger/Error-Path Hardening

### P1 � Transport/Selector Error Suppression Removal
Problem description: Transport and selector operations suppress errors via @, which hides failures and prevents deterministic failure handling.
Dialer impact: Silent stalls and delayed reconnects during network faults; reduced observability during outages.
Required invariant: Transport/selector errors are observable and never silently suppressed.
Concrete implementation direction: Remove @ operators from socket/selector calls, capture native error details (error_get_last() and errno where available), and emit structured warning/metrics before controlled close/retry.
Tasks: PR5-P1-01

### P1 � Logger Non-Throwing Under Serialization Failure
Problem description: Logger can throw JsonException during exception reporting, breaking listener isolation and dispatch loops.
Dialer impact: A single malformed log context can terminate event dispatch for the tick and violate isolation guarantees.
Required invariant: Listener exceptions cannot break dispatch loops; logging must be non-throwing.
Concrete implementation direction: Wrap Logger::log() serialization/output in internal try/catch, fall back to minimal plain-text output on encoding failure, and never throw from logger paths.
Tasks: PR5-P1-02

### P2 � Redaction Regex Validation Without Suppression
Problem description: Redaction regex evaluation is suppressed, so invalid patterns fail silently and disable redaction.
Dialer impact: Secrets can leak in logs due to hidden configuration defects.
Required invariant: Invalid redaction patterns fail fast; redaction never silently disabled.
Concrete implementation direction: Validate redaction patterns at construction, remove suppression operators, and throw InvalidConfigurationException on invalid patterns; log/metric failed evaluations deterministically.
Tasks: PR5-P2-01

### P2 � Remove Blocking DNS From Manager Bootstrap
Problem description: gethostbyname() is used during manager bootstrap for optional hostname resolution.
Dialer impact: DNS latency can block startup/reload, delaying readiness and failover.
Required invariant: No blocking DNS resolution in runtime-critical paths.
Concrete implementation direction: Keep IP-only policy default; if hostname mode is enabled, require pre-resolved addresses via config loader or resolver injection outside runtime-critical paths.
Tasks: PR5-P2-02

### P2 � Library Signal Handler Must Not Exit Process
Problem description: Signal handler calls exit(0) from library code.
Dialer impact: Embedded runtimes can be terminated unexpectedly, impacting unrelated workloads.
Required invariant: Library code must not terminate the host process.
Concrete implementation direction: Replace exit(0) with a callback/event hook so the host application decides shutdown semantics.
Tasks: PR5-P2-03

New/Updated Invariants:
- Listener exceptions cannot break dispatch loops (logger must never throw).
- No blocking DNS resolution in runtime-critical paths.
- Library code must not terminate the host process.
