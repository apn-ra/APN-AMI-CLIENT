### Delta 2026-02-26 (BATCH-PR-20260226-02): Parser/Correlation/Logging/Security Hardening

1) Parser: Configurable max frame size (P1) â€” Tasks: `PR2-P1-01`, `PR2-P1-02`
- Replace hard-coded 64KB `MAX_FRAME_SIZE` with a configurable value via `ClientOptions`.
- Set a safe default in the 1â€“4MB range and keep an upper bound to ensure bounded memory.
- Document how this interacts with `Follows` / large multi-part responses and existing strategy limits.
- Document failure behavior for over-limit frames: typed exception, connection behavior, and recovery guarantees.

2) Correlation: No synthetic success on missing response (P1) â€” Tasks: `PR2-P1-03`, `PR2-P1-04`
- If completion signals occur but the response is missing, default behavior must be typed failure (e.g., `ProtocolException`/`ConnectionLostException`) or remain pending until timeout.
- Synthetic responses are allowed ONLY for explicitly event-only strategies; document those strategies.
- Document invariants and how false positives are prevented.

3) Logging: `queue_depth` standardization (P2) â€” Task: `PR2-P2-01`
- Update logging schema guidance to normalize `queue_depth` to `null` OR require it in all queue-related logs.
- Specify which log categories MUST include `queue_depth` (enqueue/dequeue, drops, backpressure, timeouts, reconnect storms).

4) Security: Expand/configure secret redaction (P2) â€” Tasks: `PR2-P2-02`, `PR2-P2-03`
- Expand key list and add regex-based key matching (password/secret/token/auth/key/etc).
- Allow redaction policy injection/config via `ClientOptions` (`redaction_keys`, `redaction_key_patterns`) in addition to secure defaults.
- Document tests and safe defaults.

5) Correlation: Bound `ActionID` length (P2) â€” Tasks: `PR2-P2-04`, `PR2-P2-05`
- Enforce max `ActionID` length (e.g., 96â€“128 chars).
- If exceeded: truncate + stable hash suffix to preserve uniqueness (configured via `ClientOptions.max_action_id_length`).
- Document uniqueness guarantees and logging expectations.
